For example, you will get an error message if you try to evaluate 5 + \"6\" since the quotation marks would make 6 a character.\n\n\nMore on numerics: Integer vs Double\nThe two most common numeric classes are “integer” and “double” (for double precision floating point numbers). “Integers” are whole numbers like 7. “Double” are decimal values like 5.217. R uses double precision numeric values by default.\n\ndb_var &lt;- 7\nclass(db_var)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nTo create integer values, you can add L after the number.\n\nint_var &lt;- 7L\nclass(int_var)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn!\n\n\n\nPlay around with different variable types!\nHINT 💡: Replace the values in the R code with values that are provided in the instructions (the line with the comment #).

    "text": "Missing Values\nThere are several special values in R, including NA, NaN, and Inf.\nNA\nNA (short for ‘Not Available’), is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator. We use NA to replace an entry of a vector when such value is unknown or missing. There are different types of NA for different class, including NA_integer_, NA_real_, NA_complex_ and NA_character_. NA_integer is of the integer class and so on.\nMost operations on an NA becomes an NA. For instance,\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 4)\nsum(x)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nHowever, there is an exception - when we use the paste() function to concatenate NA with other strings.

If you would like it to remain as a data frame, you can use my_df[, 1, drop = FALSE].\nAlternatively, if you would like to select a certain variable from the data frame, you can use the column name in the square bracket directly or use $ instead: my_df[ , \"column_name\"] or my_df$column_name.\n\n\nSorting\nSometimes we may want to sort the data according to a certain variable in the dataset. In R, we can use the order() function which gives the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable.

    "text": "Background\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Posit for R programming language. It includes tools for script editing, R console output, data viewing, and plotting, making it easier for an analyst to explore, visualise, and conduct analysis on the data in a single environment.\n\n\nWhat does it look like?\nThe default appearances of the RStudio user interface contains 4 primary panes:\n\nSource pane\nConsole pane\nEnvironment pane\nOutput pane\n\nThe first time you open the RStudio, you will be greeted by the three panes: console, environment, and output. We will talk about the Source pane later in the chapter.\n\nOn the top right-hand side, you have the Environment pane, which includes the Environment, History, Connections, Build, and Version Control System (VCS) tabs. We will focus on the Environment tab, which shows the currently saved R objects.\nOutput pane, located at the bottom-right of the app, is used to display various outputs such as plots, HTML content, or files directory. You can interact with it as well, not just for shows. For example, in the “Files” tab, you can add new folders, new blank files, delete/rename, and more.\nOn the left-hand side, you have the Console pane, which is the place where you can type out the command written in the R language and execute it immediately on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can run the R code inside the Console, but once you close RStudio, you will lose all the code.\n\n\nTo make your work reproducible, you should write and store all the code in the R Script (.R). It will show up in the Source pane, allowing you to view and edit various code-related files.\n\n\n\nR Script\nThere are multiple ways of adding the R Script. To get started, click on the paper with a plus symbol and choose R Script.\n\nIn an R Script, you can write code and add comments. Also, you can run each line of code by pressing ctrl + enter/return on Windows and Linux or cmd + enter/return on Macs. The code messages will shown in the Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate R script\n\n\n\nThere is a shortcut key for creating a new R Script, which is ctrl + shift + N for Windows and Linux or cmd + shift + N for Macs.\n\n\n\n\nR packages installation and loading\nAn R package bundles all useful functions, help files, and data sets that help extend the functionality into a package. To start installing the package, navigate to the “Packages” tab in the Output pane. It will show you what packages you currently have. Next, click “Install”, and you should be able to see the pop-up window. Type the package name you want to install in the “Packages” field. You need to make sure that you install all the dependencies by clicking on the box labeled “Install dependencies”. Then click “Install”, you are now ready to start using the new package.\nAlternatively, you can install the package by running install.packages(\"package_name\") in the Console pane. The packages only need to be installed once, and install.packages() should not be kept or commented out in the R code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault packages\n\n\n\nR, by default, comes bundled with some basic packages that are always loaded, including base (for basic things like + and log()), utils (for utility functions like install.packages()), and stats (for statistical models like lm() and arima()).\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have a package installed, you can bring it to your current working environment by typing library(package_name) in the Console pane. All of the package’s functions, data sets, and help files are now available for you to use until you close your current R session. So, if you have closed it, you will need to load the R packages again.\nYou should load the packages you used at the top of the R Script. This way, you do not need to remember which packages you need in the script. It is also a good practice to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed we do not use quotation marks when calling the package in the library function. You have options to use them if you like for this function. However, the quotation marks are necessary for the install.packages function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn!\n\n\n\nIt is now your turn to try out the package installation process. What you need to do is to get the palmerpenguins package so we can have a look at the penguin’s data.\n\n\n\n  🟡 Loading\n    webR...\n  💡 Check answer\n  ✅ Show solution\n  💥 Reset code"

    "text": "R Projects\nAn R Project is a powerful feature in RStudio that helps you organise your work. Using an R Project creates a self-contained workspace that includes all relevant scripts, data files, and outputs for your analysis.\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nUsing an R Project for your work offers several key benefits:\n\nSetting the working directory: When you open an R Project, RStudio automatically sets the working directory to the folder where the project is saved. You should almost never use setwd() to change the working directory, needing to change your working directory is a symptom of poorly organised projects.\nProject settings: R Projects also restore project-specific settings, and RStudio’s tools and shortcuts will adjust to the type of project. Projects with version control (e.g. git) will have a git tab, R package projects will include shortcuts for package development, and writing projects (e.g. R Markdown and Quarto) will make it easy to knit/render your document.\nRestoring workspace: R Projects also preserve the state of your workspace, so when you reopen a project, previously opened scripts, unsaved changes, and the R console history are restored. This helps you pick up where you left off, reducing the time spent reloading or redoing work.\nA home for project files: With a clear project structure, other collaborators can easily access and understand your work - simply open the project file! The consistent folder structure and using relative paths make it easy for them to access the data and reproduce your analysis on their own systems.\n\n\nCreating R projects\n\nClick the project drop-down in the top-right corner. Then click on the “New Project…”.\n\n\n\nIt will show you three options.\n\nNew Directory: Start from scratch with a new empty folder for your project.\nExisting Directory: If you’re already started some work without a project, convert that folder into a project.\nVersion Control: If your work already exists elsewhere as a git or svn repository (such as GitHub), this will download the work and create a project for it.\n\nFor your very first R project, let’s start by selecting “New Directory”.\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of R projects that you can create. These various project types come bundled with a boilerplate file structure and some project settings (for shortcuts and build options). A standard project (without any boilerplate or settings) is suitable most projects - so simply select “New Project” for an empty folder.\n\n\n\nGive your project (and the folder containing it) a name using the “Directory name:” field. You can also choose where the project will exist on your computer by clicking on the “Browse…” button. If you do not choose, it will be in your home directory. You can leave the rest (git and renv) unchecked for now.\n\n\n\nClick “Create Project”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject created!\n\n\n\nYou have now successfully created the R project!\nVerify this by checking:\n\nThe project name in the top right project dropdown\nThe current working directory (getwd()) is the project folder\nThe files pane shows the content of your project folder\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing R projects\nThere are multiple ways to open an R Project in RStudio:\n\nRStudio Project Selector:\nIn the top right corner of RStudio, you’ll see a project selector dropdown. Clicking on it will display a list of recently opened R Projects, allowing you to quickly switch between projects you want to work on.\n\nOpening the .Rproj File:\nYou can also open an R Project directly by locating the .Rproj file on your computer and double-clicking it. This will open RStudio and automatically set the working directory to the project’s folder. If you’re already in RStudio, you can also open the .Rproj file via File → Open Project.\n\nAny work you do while in this project will be restored when you next open the project (even unsaved files, but please don’t rely on this and save your work!).\nYou can close the project by simply closing RStudio (or via Project selector (top-right) → Close Project to keep RStudio open). When you close your project you might be prompted to save your ‘workspace image’, to which we recommend you select Don’t Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving the workspace image? No!\n\n\n\nWhile you should always save your work, it is best for reproducibility to not save your workspace image.\nWhen you work in RStudio, the workspace refers to all the objects (such as variables, data frames, functions, etc.) that are stored in your R environment during the session. RStudio offers to saves this workspace to a file called .RData when you close the project or RStudio itself. This file contains all the objects from your session, so when you reopen the project, RStudio will automatically load these objects back into the environment.\nSave the workspace means storing all of the objects you’ve created for the next time you open the project. It may sound tempting to do it, but it is bad for reproducibility. If you rely on previously saved objects, such as datasets or analysis results, you might skip the process of reloading or regenerating data, which undermines the reproducibility of your work. It’s always better to explicitly load data and scripts each time you open a project, ensuring that the analysis can be replicated by anyone, including your future self.\nYou can prevent the popup messages by going to Tools → Global Options. Then select General on the side-bar and change “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject organisation\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nWhile an R Project helps you quickly switch between projects, it is up to you to organise your project files into suitable folders. By structuring your files effectively, you can reduce the risk of losing important data, simplify the code for accessing your data, and make it easy to locate each script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject portability\n\n\n\nAll files for the project should be contained within the project folder.\nWhen you share your project folder with others, it should contain all of the data, code, and other resources necessary for them to replicate your work.\n\n\n\nFile folders\nA clear and consistent folder structure is essential for any project. The names of folders is a personal choice, however there are some commonly used folder names we recommend. Here’s an example of a typical R Project directory structure:\nmy-awesome-project/\n├── data-raw/                   # Raw / unprocessed data files\n│   ├── survey_results_2024.csv\n│   ├── population_data.xlsx\n├── data/                       # Clean / processed data files\n│   ├── survey_cleaned_2024.csv\n│   ├── population_summary.csv\n├── R/                          # R scripts\n│   ├── data_cleaning.R\n│   ├── exploratory_analysis.R\n│   └── model_fitting.R\n├── outputs/                    # Results, figures, tables, and other outputs\n│   ├── figures/                # Graphs and charts\n│   │   ├── age_distribution_plot.png\n│   │   └── time_series_trends.jpeg\n│   └── tables/                 # Data tables and results\n│       ├── regression_summary.csv\n├── README.md                   # Project description and instructions\n└── my-awesome-project.Rproj    # R Project file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolder Descriptions\n\n\n\n\ndata-raw/: This folder holds all original data files related to the project. Keeping raw and processed data separate ensures transparency and helps maintain data integrity.\ndata/: Save your tidy, clean and otherwise processed data here. This allows you to quickly read in analysis-ready data without needing to re-run your data cleaning script.\nR/: Store all your R scripts here, we recommend the folder name “R” (to match the structure of an R package). More language-agnostic projects might use a “src”, “scripts”, or “code” folder. It’s a good practice to separate scripts into different categories depending on their function (e.g., data cleaning, analysis, modelling).\noutputs/: This folder stores the outputs of your analysis, such as figures, tables, or models. You can have subfolders like figures/ and tables/ to separate the different types of results. This makes it easier to find specific outputs and ensures that your working directory isn’t cluttered with unnecessary files.\nREADME.md: A README file is essential for documenting the purpose of the project, how to run the analysis, and any specific instructions for collaborators. This file helps others (and yourself, in the future) understand the project structure, dependencies, and key steps involved.\nmy-awesome-project.Rproj: This is the R Project file, which we created earlier. Projects help maintain your project’s workspace, settings, and set the working directory. It should always be kept at the root of the project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-contained reproducible projects\nOne of the key principles of maintaining an organised and reproducible workflow is to keep all project-related files within the project folder. This approach ensures that your project has:\n\nReproducibility: By keeping everything in one place, you ensure that your code can easily locate all the necessary files (data, scripts, outputs) using relative paths. This makes your analysis reproducible for anyone who accesses the project.\nPortability: A self-contained project is portable, meaning you can move it to another computer, share it with collaborators, or distribute it with version control platforms (e.g. GitHub) without breaking any links or dependencies.\nOrganisation: Storing all files in one structured location helps avoid confusion and ensures you can quickly locate the resources you need.\nConsistency: External dependencies, such as files stored elsewhere on your computer, can change, be moved, or be deleted, breaking your workflow. Keeping everything within the project folder avoids this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR packages not included\n\n\n\nR projects usually include everything except the R packages it depends on, which are instead usually found in the system’s global R environment.\nThis can cause reproducibility issues if the project is used on a system where some packages are missing, incompatible, or at different versions with different functionality. To address this, you can use the renv package, which bundles and manages package versions locally within the project folder. This ensures that your analysis always uses the correct versions of dependencies."

    "section": "File Paths",
    "text": "File Paths\nWhen working with files in R, understanding and using file paths correctly is essential to ensure your scripts run seamlessly, whether on your computer or someone else’s.\n\n\nFile paths can be defined in two main ways: absolute paths and relative paths. Both approaches work to locate files, but they behave very differently when running your code on other computers. Understanding how to use these paths effectively is crucial for reproducibly accessing your files from scripts and keeping your project portable (shareable with others).\n\nAbsolute paths\nAn absolute path specifies the full location of a file or folder on your system starting from the root directory (e.g., C:/ on Windows or / on macOS/Linux).\nExample:\n# Windows\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/Admin/Documents/my-awesome-project/data/survey_data.csv\")\n\n# macOS/Linux\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"/home/Admin/Documents/my-awesome-project/data/survey_data.csv\")\nNotice how the file path is differs between operating systems? This is bad for reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute paths are NOT portable!\n\n\n\nWhile absolute paths work on your computer, they are not portable because:\n\nThey depend on the exact file structure of your system.\nIf you share your project with others, their systems may not have the same directory structure.\nMoving your project to a new location can break the paths.\n\nFor this reason, absolute paths are strongly discouraged in R scripts.\n\n\n\n\nRelative paths\nA relative path specifies the location of a file or folder relative to the current working directory. The current working directory is your project folder (if you’re working within an R project).\nWhen using R Projects, the working directory is automatically set to the root of the project, making relative paths the most reliable and portable option.\nExample:\n# Windows/macOS/Linux\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/survey_data.csv\")\nIn this example:\n\n./ refers to the current working directory (the project folder). It is optional.\n./data/ navigates to the data/ subfolder within the project folder.\n\nRelative paths ensure that your scripts work regardless of where the project folder is located, as long as the folder structure remains consistent. This makes them ideal for reproducible analysis. 🎉\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding files\n\n\n\nWhen specifying file paths in R, you can use tab completion to quickly find and insert file paths. Inside quotation marks (““), start typing the folder or file name and press the TabTab key.\nRStudio will then show a list of matching files and folders, making it easier to navigate your project, find files and avoid typos.\nVideo\n\n\n\nWorking directories\nThe working directory in R is the folder where R looks for files using relative paths. The working directory is almost always your project folder.\nYou can check your current working directory with the getwd() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function returns the absolute path of the current working directory.\nYou can (but shouldn’t) change your working directory with setwd(). Instead, we strongly recommend using R Projects and relative paths from the project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking directory in R Markdown and Quarto\n\n\n\nWhen running R Markdown or Quarto documents, the working directory is instead the location of the document. You can think of these documents as being their own mini-projects, where files paths to images and data is relative to the document.\nIf your document is in a sub-folder of an R project the relative paths can be confusing. R scripts will use the project folder, while your R documents will use the document folder!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe here package\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nThe here package helps you create file paths relative to the project folder, ensuring that your scripts and analyses are portable and reproducible across different systems. The here() function automatically detects the project folder based on the location of your .Rproj file (or other indicators, like a README.md or .git folder).\nIf you’re writing scripts within an R Project, the here() function will give the same result as using relative paths. The key difference is that the here() function will also use the project folder for documents too.\n\n\n\n\nExternal paths\nExternal paths refer to file locations external to the computer you are using but accessible over a network connection. An example of an external path is https://learnr.numbat.space/data/survey_results.csv. We use a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to specify these paths, which consists of several parts:\n\nProtocol (https://): The communication method used to access the resource. Most often this will be http or https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, the protocol for websites). Other protocols that are commonly used include ftp (File Transfer Protocol), or s3 (Simply Storage Service).\nAddress / Location (learnr.numbat.space): The network address of the server hosting the resource. In this case, learnr.numbat.space is the address, identifying the specific server to connect to.\n\nPath (/data/survey_results.csv): The absolute path of the file or resource on the server.\nOther Information: Sometimes additional details are needed to connect to the external server, commonly this is:\n\nA port number like :8080 specifies a network port (https://learnr.numbat.space:8080/...).\n\nCredentials like username:password@ can provide login information (https://user:pass@learnr.numbat.space/...).\n\n\nMany R functions allow you to directly use web URLs for accessing data, for example:\n\nReading data with read.csv() or readr::read_csv()\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"https://learnr.numbat.space/data/survey_results.csv\")\nDownloading files with download.file(), particularly useful if the function you want doesn’t support external file paths.\ndownload.file(\"https://learnr.numbat.space/data/survey_results.csv\", destfile = \"data/survey_results.csv\")\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/survey_results.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\nWhich of the following is an example of an absolute path?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you avoid using absolute paths in R scripts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the {here} package do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is NOT true about relative paths?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich part of the URL specifies the communication method for the external resource?"

Often people say that the data is confidential and can’t be provided, but usually the problem isn’t specific to the data you are using. Taking the time to try your code on a different dataset is a good debugging step, and R provides many good datasets to use in these examples built in. You can find a complete list of datasets available to all R users with the data(package = \"datasets\") function.\nIf you do need to use a custom dataset specific to your project, try reducing the size of the dataset before making your example. The error may only occur for some specific rows of your data. Once you’ve narrowed in on the issue, you can convert your minimal data object to code for producing it using the dput() function.\nFor example you can use use the below code to provide the first 6 rows of the iris dataset.\n\ndput(head(iris))\n\nstructure(list(Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5, 5.4), \n    Sepal.Width = c(3.5, 3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9), Petal.Length = c(1.4, \n    1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7), Petal.Width = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, \n    0.2, 0.2, 0.4), Species = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, \n    1L), levels = c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\"), class = \"factor\")), row.names = c(NA, \n6L), class = \"data.frame\")\n\n\nTry it yourself!

    "text": "Provide session information\nSometimes the error is specific to the version of R, or the packages you are using. To help others help you, you can provide the session information using the sessioninfo::sessionInfo() function. This will print out the version of R you are using, and the versions of the packages you have loaded, which makes it easier to fix some version, language or OS specific problems. A good reproducible example should come with this session information output."

    "text": "Using the reprex package for producing examples\nthe reprex package is a useful tool that can help you make a reproducible example. It can be used to run the code in your example in a clean environment, which is a good way to test if you’ve included everything necessary for others to reproduce the error. It’ll also copy a neatly formatted version of your example which will also display in your Viewer window and includes images and console output from the example as it runs on your computer. It can even include a collapsible summary of your session information.\nTo use reprex:\n\nInstall it from CRAN using install.packages(\"reprex\").\nOnce installed, load in the reprex package using library(reprex)\nYou can use the reprex() function to create a reproducible example.\n\nYou can also use the reprex() function in RStudio by selecting the code you want to include in the example, and clicking the “Reprex” button in the Addins menu.\n\n    \n    \n\nAfter clicking Render reprex... in the Addins menu, a new window will pop up with the reprex output (left image). As you’ve copied the example, you can use the ‘on the clipboard’ source. Choose a venue for where you’re planning to post the question, and tick ‘Append session info’. Finally, press Render to run the code and see if it’s reproducible.\nView this short clip to see how to use the reprex package."
