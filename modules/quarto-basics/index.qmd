# A Brief History Lesson: Sweave to Quarto

Before delving into the basics of `Quarto`, it may be worthwhile to know the *brief* history of its predecessors.

## Sweave

`Sweave` is a tool that allows you to embed `R` code in LaTeX documents and was developed as one of the earlier tools for literate programming in `R`. `Sweave` integrates the statistical power of `R` with the typesetting capabilities of LaTex, laying the groundwork for more flexible and user-friendly tools like `R Markdown` and `Quarto`.

## R Markdown

R Markdown is a another file format for creating documents with R. It can be considered a modern approach to `sweave`. It allows a combination of text and R code in a single document to create reports, presentations, and websites. A primary difference between R Markdown and Sweave is that R Markdown is not tied to LaTeX, and can be used with other output formats like HTML, PDF, and Word.

# Quarto Fundamentals

Quarto documents are written in a marking with Quarto extensions. This makes Quarto easy to read and write, while still providing powerful features for creating complex documents.

Since Quarto is built on top of the R Markdown ecosystem, you can use **R code chunks** to embed code and create visualisations in your documents. This makes it easy to create **reproducible reports** that can be easily shared and updated, and makes a lot of already existing `Rmd` files executable without much modification.

## Quarto: Multi-Language and Multi-Engine

Quarto is not only limited to R code chunks, and you can also use **Python, Julia, and SQL code chunks** in your Quarto documents.

R Markdown on the other hand is tied to R, and has a dependency and requirement for R.
:::

Quarto also provides a range of [**built-in templates**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) that you can use to create documents for different purposes, such as **academic papers, presentations, and websites.** These templates make it easy to get started with Quarto and create professional-looking documents with minimal effort.

## Setting Up Quarto

To get started with Quarto, you will need to **install the Quarto package** in R. You can do this by running the following command in the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("quarto")
```

Once you have installed the Quarto package, you can create a new Quarto document by:

1.  Go to the File menu in RStudio

2.  Select New `File` \> `New File` \> `Quarto Document`

![](images/select_new.png){width="307" fig-align="center"}

3.  Choose the document type: `Document`, `Presentation`, or `Interactive`.

![](images/document_type.png){width="347" fig-align="center"}

A Quarto file is a plain text file with the extension `.qmd`.

Now that you've got your first `quarto` document up and ready, let's explore some *key components!* These include:

* A YAML header

* Chunks of R code

* Markdown text

## YAML

When you open up your first `quarto` document, you will notice a block of text up the top that looks something like this:

![](images/yaml.png){width="347" fig-align="center"}

This is called a YAML header, and it contains metadata about your document, such as the title, author, and date. The basic structure allows you to edit the title of the document (which at the moment is "Untitled"), advises you the output will be in `html format` and the document will open in the `visual editor` by default.

# Source vs Visual Editor

[RStudio v1.4](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or higher includes Visual Markdown editing, offering a user-friendly interface. Instead of markdown syntax (e.g., **bolding** with double asterisks), you can format text, add images and insert tables using a toolbar or keyboard commands, similar to a word processor. View sections [28.3 and 28.4](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto) for more detail.

Beyond the basics, you can add some real handy components to the [YAML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html)

|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| author                                               | For assignments especially, its good to include your name and potentially student ID with this section in the YAML.                                                                                                       |

## YAML Structure
The structure of a YAML can be a little finicky, and errors may occur if it is not formatted correctly. If you  encountering errors or missing components - it may be worthwhile to cross-check. A useful starting point is the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/opml.html).

## R Code Chunks

Code chunks refer to sections in the document where you can write and execute code. These chunks are enclosed by three backticks followed by the name of the language you are using (e.g., `r` for R code). Code chunks can be included in three ways:

1. Keyboard commands: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac)
2. Clicking the `Insert` button in the toolbar (top right):

![](images/insert.png){width="347" fig-align="center"}

3. Typing the code chunk manually:

![](images/code_chunk.png){width="300" fig-align="center"}

Write the code you want to include within the chunk and when you run it, the output will be displayed directly below the chunk!

You can also add options to the code chunk to control how the code is executed and displayed. For example, you can specify the output format, the width and height of plots, and whether the code should be displayed in the output. 

![](images/chunk_options.png){width="347" fig-align="center"}

Look at the image of the code chunk above, you can see that the chunk has the following options:
`fig-cap`: This option allows you to add a caption to the figure.
`fig-width`: This option specifies the width of the figure.
`echo`: This option controls whether the code in the chunk is displayed in the output.

These are only a couple examples of options for chunk options, and there are many more available. You can find a full list of chunk options in [section 28.5.2](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto). However a helpful table of more commonly used options and what they assist with retrieved from `R for Data Science` can be seen below:

![](images/option_table.png){width="600" fig-align="center"}

::: callout-tip
## Global Options
Now you know how to add options to individual chunks - however, you can also add global options to the entire document. This can be done in the YAML header by including `execute:` and then in the next line, press tab to indent and add the options you want to apply to all code chunks in the document.

** potentially a multiple choice question here about different common chunk options and what they do ??**
