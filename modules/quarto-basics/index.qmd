# A Brief History Lesson: Sweave to Quarto

Before delving into the basics of `Quarto`, it may be worthwhile to know the *brief* history of its predecessors.

## Sweave

`Sweave` is a tool that allows you to embed `R` code in LaTeX documents and was developed as one of the earlier tools for literate programming in `R`. `Sweave` integrates the statistical power of `R` with the typesetting capabilities of LaTex, laying the groundwork for more flexible and user-friendly tools like `R Markdown` and `Quarto`.


## R Markdown

R Markdown is a another file format for creating documents with R. It can be considered a modern approach to `sweave`. It allows a combination of text and R code in a single document to create reports, presentations, and websites. A primary difference between R Markdown and Sweave is that R Markdown is not tied to LaTeX, and can be used with other output formats like HTML, PDF, and Word.

# Quarto Fundamentals

Quarto documents are written in a marking with Quarto extensions. This makes Quarto easy to read and write, while still providing powerful features for creating complex documents.

Since Quarto is built on top of the R Markdown ecosystem, you can use **R code chunks** to embed code and create visualisations in your documents. This makes it easy to create **reproducible reports** that can be easily shared and updated, and makes a lot of already existing `Rmd` files executable without much modification.

## Quarto: Multi-Language and Multi-Engine
Quarto is not only limited to R code chunks, and you can also use **Python, Julia, and SQL code chunks** in your Quarto documents.

R Markdown on the other hand is tied to R, and has a dependency and requirement for R.

Quarto also provides a range of [**built-in templates**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) that you can use to create documents for different purposes, such as **academic papers, presentations, and websites.** These templates make it easy to get started with Quarto and create professional-looking documents with minimal effort.

## Setting Up Quarto

To get started with Quarto, you will need to **install the Quarto package** in R. You can do this by running the following command in the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("quarto")
```

Once you have installed the Quarto package, you can create a new Quarto document by:

1.  Go to the File menu in RStudio

2.  Select New `File` \> `New File` \> `Quarto Document`

**Now that you've got your first `quarto` document up and ready, let's explore some key components!**
