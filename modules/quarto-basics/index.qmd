# What is Quarto?

Quarto is a **open-source, technical publishing system** that allows you to create **interactive and reproducible** documents with ease. It is built on top of the R Markdown ecosystem and provides a range of features that make it easy to create documents for a **variety of purposes.**

## Understanding Quarto Fundamentals

Quarto documents are written in a marking with Quarto extensions. This makes Quarto easy to read and write, while still providing powerful features for creating complex documents.

Since Quarto is built on top of the R Markdown ecosystem, you can use **R code chunks** to embed code and create interactive visualisations in your documents. This makes it easy to create **reproducible reports** that can be easily shared and updated, and makes a lot of already existing `Rmd` files executable without modification.

Quarto also provides a range of [**built-in templates**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) that you can use to create documents for different purposes, such as **academic papers, presentations, and websites.** These templates make it easy to get started with Quarto and create professional-looking documents with minimal effort.

## Setting Up Quarto

To get started with Quarto, you will need to **install the Quarto package** in R. You can do this by running the following command in the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("quarto")
```

Once you have installed the Quarto package, you can create a new Quarto document by:

1.  Go to the File menu in RStudio

2.  Select New `File` \> `New File` \> `Quarto Document`
