If you would like it to remain as a data frame, you can use my_df[, 1, drop = FALSE].\nAlternatively, if you would like to select a certain variable from the data frame, you can use the column name in the square bracket directly or use $ instead: my_df[ , \"column_name\"] or my_df$column_name.\n\n\nSorting\nSometimes we may want to sort the data according to a certain variable in the dataset. In R, we can use the order() function which gives the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable. For example,\n\nx &lt;- c(100, -200,300)\norder(x)\n\n[1] 2 1 3\n\n\nThe output above is the ranked positions and we can use that to sort the vector x.\n\nx[order(x)]\n\n[1] -200  100  300\n\n\nThe above R code gives an ordered version of x.\nNow that we know how to use the order(), let‚Äôs sort the first_ten_element data frame in ascending order of atomic_no, assign the sorted dataframe to sorted_df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nComplete the code below to complete the tasks indicated in the comments.\nHint: Use order(first_ten_elements$atomic_no) to create positions.

Here are a few useful commands that helps you understand the data frame very quickly.\n\nhead() shows the first few observations of a data frame.\ntail() shows the last few observations of a data frame.\nstr() shows the structure of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn!\n\n\n\nInvestigate the structure of the example dataframe.

You can include different vectors as argument in the function and they will become different columns of your data frame. Note that you should make sure the vectors that you pass have same length (i.e.¬†same number of observations for each column).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nCreate a data frame using vectors symbol, element, chemical_group and atomic_no, following that order.

If you would like it to remain as a data frame, you can use my_df[, 1, drop = FALSE].\nAlternatively, if you would like to select a certain variable from the data frame, you can use the column name in the square bracket directly or use $ instead: my_df[ , \"column_name\"] or my_df$column_name.\n\n\nSorting\nSometimes we may want to sort the data according to a certain variable in the dataset. In R, we can use the order() function which gives the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable. For example,\n\nx &lt;- c(100, -200,300)\norder(x)\n\n[1] 2 1 3\n\n\nThe output above is the ranked positions and we can use that to sort the vector x.\n\nx[order(x)]\n\n[1] -200  100  300\n\n\nThe above R code gives an ordered version of x.\nNow that we know how to use the order(), let‚Äôs sort the first_ten_element data frame in ascending order of atomic_no, assign the sorted dataframe to sorted_df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nComplete the code below to complete the tasks indicated in the comments.\nHint: Use order(first_ten_elements$atomic_no) to create positions. Then, use ‚Äòpositions‚Äô with square brackets: first_ten_elements[...]; can you fill in the ‚Ä¶? Do not forget that ‚Äòpositions‚Äô indicates the order of the rows in the data frame.\n\n\n\n  üü° Loading\n    webR...\n  üí° Check answer\n  ‚úÖ Show solution\n  üí• Reset code"
